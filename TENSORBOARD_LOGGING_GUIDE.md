## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Options

In `config.py`, you can customize logging behavior:

```python
# Logging frequencies
LOG_EVERY_EPOCHS = 1                    # Basic logging frequency
DIAGNOSTIC_LOG_EVERY_STEPS = 500        # Detailed diagnostics
TENSORBOARD_FLUSH_EVERY_STEPS = 500     # TensorBoard flush frequency

# Advanced logging features
ENABLE_GRADIENT_HISTOGRAMS = True       # Gradient distribution tracking
ENABLE_PARAMETER_TRACKING = True        # Parameter evolution tracking
ENABLE_VIDEO_LOGGING = True             # Generated video logging
ENABLE_NOISE_VISUALIZATION = True       # Noise prediction visualization
ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_PROFILING = True     # Performance metrics
```

## üìä Best Practices

### 1. **Monitor These Key Metrics**
- **01_Training/Loss**: Should decrease smoothly over time
- **06_Diffusion/Noise_Prediction_MSE**: Lower is better for noise prediction
- **06_Diffusion/Signal_to_Noise_Ratio**: Higher indicates better training data
- **11_Gradient_Stats/Total_Gradient_Norm**: Should be stable, not exploding

### 2. **Use Video Logging Effectively**
- Check **12_Generated_Samples** regularly to see model progress
- Compare **13_Noise_Visualization** videos to understand model behavior
- Look for improvements in sample quality over epochs

### 3. **Performance Optimization**
- Monitor **14_System/GPU_Memory_Allocated_GB** to optimize batch size
- Track **05_Performance/Samples_Per_Second** to identify bottlenecks
- Use **04_Learning_Rate** to fine-tune scheduling

### 4. **Debugging Training Issues**
- If loss plateaus: Check learning rate scheduling in **04_Learning_Rate**
- If samples are poor: Examine noise prediction quality in **06_Diffusion**
- If training is slow: Check system metrics in **14_System**

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**TensorBoard not showing videos:**
- Ensure `ENABLE_VIDEO_LOGGING = True` in config
- Check that samples are being generated (look for log messages)
- Videos appear in **12_Generated_Samples** and **13_Noise_Visualization**

**High memory usage:**
- Set `ENABLE_GRADIENT_HISTOGRAMS = False` to reduce memory
- Increase `DIAGNOSTIC_LOG_EVERY_STEPS` to log less frequently
- Monitor **14_System** category for memory tracking

**Missing metrics:**
- Check that training has started (some metrics only appear after first epoch)
- Verify logging frequencies in config
- Look for error messages in console output
