# Progress Bar Enhancements for Text2Sign Diffusion Model

## Overview

Added comprehensive tqdm progress bars to all important procedures in the diffusion model training and sampling process. This provides real-time feedback and better user experience during long-running operations.

## Enhanced Components

### 1. Training Progress (`train.py`)

#### Epoch-Level Progress
- **Overall training progress** across all epochs
- Shows current epoch, total epochs, average loss, and time per epoch
- Format: `Training - Epoch X/Y | loss: 0.xxxx | time: Xs`

#### Batch-Level Progress  
- **Per-epoch batch processing** with detailed metrics
- Shows loss, running average, and learning rate
- Format: `Epoch X | loss: 0.xxxx | avg_loss: 0.xxxx | lr: 0.xxxxxx`

#### Special Procedures
- **Sample generation**: Progress indication when generating samples for logging
- **Checkpoint saving**: Progress indication when saving model checkpoints
- **Setup process**: Visual feedback during training component initialization

```python
# Example output:
ðŸ“Š Setting up data loader...
âœ… Data loader ready: 128 batches

ðŸ¤– Creating diffusion model...
âœ… Model created and moved to mps

Training - Epoch 1/10: 100%|â–ˆâ–ˆ| 10/10 [00:45<00:00, loss: 1.2345, time: 45s]
Epoch 0: 100%|â–ˆâ–ˆ| 128/128 [02:15<00:00, loss: 1.234, avg_loss: 1.245, lr: 0.000100]
```

### 2. Diffusion Sampling Progress (`diffusion.py`)

#### Reverse Diffusion Process
- **1000-timestep sampling process** with real-time updates
- Shows current timestep and progress through denoising
- Format: `Sampling | timestep: XXX`

```python
# Example output:
Sampling: 100%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ| 1000/1000 [00:30<00:00, 33.2step/s, timestep=0]
```

### 3. Dataset Loading Progress (`dataset.py`)

#### File Discovery and Validation
- **File scanning progress** when initializing dataset
- **File validation progress** to ensure GIF-text pairs exist
- Shows number of valid pairs found

```python
# Example output:
Scanning for GIF files in training_data/...
Validating files: 100%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ| 4082/4082 [00:02<00:00, 1825.4file/s]
Found 4082 valid GIF-text pairs in training_data
```

## Progress Bar Features

### Visual Elements
- **Unicode progress bars** with completion percentage
- **Estimated time remaining** (ETA) and elapsed time
- **Processing rate** (items/second)
- **Dynamic descriptions** that update based on current operation

### Nested Progress Bars
- **Epoch-level**: Overall training progress
- **Batch-level**: Per-epoch progress (automatically cleared)
- **Sampling**: Diffusion timestep progress

### Real-Time Metrics
- **Training**: Loss, learning rate, average loss
- **Sampling**: Current timestep
- **Data loading**: Files processed, validation status

## Usage Examples

### Basic Training with Progress
```python
# Automatic progress bars in training
trainer = setup_training(Config)
trainer.train()  # Shows epoch and batch progress
```

### Manual Sample Generation
```python
# Progress bar for sampling
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    samples = model.p_sample(shape)  # Shows timestep progress
```

### Dataset Initialization
```python
# Progress bar for dataset setup
dataset = SignLanguageDataset(data_root)  # Shows file validation
```

## Testing

### Progress Bar Verification
Run the test script to verify tqdm functionality:
```bash
python test_progress.py
```

### Full System Demo
Run the comprehensive demo to see all progress bars:
```bash
python demo_with_progress.py
```

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Visual feedback** for long-running operations
- **Time estimates** for planning and monitoring
- **Real-time metrics** for training monitoring
- **Professional appearance** with consistent formatting

### Development Benefits
- **Easy debugging** with detailed progress information
- **Performance monitoring** with processing rates
- **Clear operation status** during training and sampling

### MacBook M4 Optimization
- **Lightweight progress bars** that don't impact performance
- **Efficient updates** that work well with MPS backend
- **Minimal memory overhead** for progress tracking

## Configuration

All progress bars can be controlled through environment variables:
```bash
# Disable all progress bars (for logging/automation)
export TQDM_DISABLE=1

# Customize progress bar format
export TQDM_NCOLS=100
```

## Integration Notes

- Progress bars automatically adapt to terminal width
- Nested bars are properly managed (batch bars clear after each epoch)
- Compatible with Jupyter notebooks and terminal environments
- Handles interruption gracefully (Ctrl+C)

This enhancement significantly improves the user experience when training the diffusion model, especially for long training sessions on MacBook M4 hardware.
