# TensorBoard Flush Improvements

## Summary
Enhanced TensorBoard logging to flush data more frequently, ensuring real-time visualization of training progress.

## Changes Made

### 1. Increased Logging Frequency
- **File:** `config.py`
- **Change:** Reduced `LOG_EVERY` from 10 to 5 steps
- **Impact:** Loss and learning rate metrics now logged every 5 steps instead of 10

### 2. Added Strategic Flush Points
- **File:** `train.py`
- **Locations where flush() is now called:**

#### a. Model Structure Logging
```python
self.writer.add_graph(self.model.model, (dummy_input, dummy_time))
self.writer.flush()  # Flush model graph immediately
```

#### b. Configuration Logging
```python
self.writer.add_text('config', config_text, 0)
self.writer.flush()  # Flush configuration immediately
```

#### c. Training Metrics Logging
```python
self.writer.add_scalar('train/loss', loss.item(), self.global_step)
self.writer.add_scalar('train/learning_rate', self.optimizer.param_groups[0]['lr'], self.global_step)
self.writer.flush()  # Flush to TensorBoard immediately
```

#### d. Sample Images Logging
```python
self.writer.add_image(...)
# ... (for all samples)
self.writer.flush()  # Flush after logging all samples
```

#### e. Epoch Metrics Logging
```python
self.writer.add_scalar('epoch/loss', metrics['loss'], epoch)
self.writer.add_scalar('epoch/time', epoch_time, epoch)
self.writer.flush()  # Flush epoch metrics immediately
```

#### f. Regular Training Updates
```python
# Flush TensorBoard regularly for real-time updates (every 3 steps)
if self.global_step % 3 == 0:
    self.writer.flush()
```

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Monitoring:** TensorBoard updates appear immediately without waiting for buffer to fill
2. **Better Debugging:** Immediate feedback when training starts or encounters issues
3. **Improved User Experience:** No delay in seeing training progress in TensorBoard dashboard
4. **More Responsive Logging:** Critical events (epoch completion, sample generation) are immediately visible

## Performance Considerations

- Flushing every 3 steps provides good balance between real-time updates and performance
- Strategic flushing at important events ensures critical data is immediately available
- Regular flushing prevents loss of data if training is interrupted

## How to Monitor

1. **Start TensorBoard:**
   ```bash
   ./start_tensorboard.sh
   ```

2. **Open TensorBoard in browser:** http://localhost:6006

3. **Observe real-time updates:**
   - Training loss updates every 5 steps
   - Regular flushes every 3 steps ensure immediate visibility
   - Sample images and epoch metrics appear immediately when generated

## Technical Details

- **TensorBoard SummaryWriter** buffers writes by default for performance
- Adding `flush()` calls forces immediate write to disk
- Balance between real-time updates and training performance is maintained
- All critical logging points now have explicit flush operations
