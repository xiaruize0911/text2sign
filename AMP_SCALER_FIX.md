## AMP Scaler Error Fix Summary

### Error Description
```
AssertionError: No inf checks were recorded for this optimizer.
```

This error occurs when using PyTorch's GradScaler for Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) training, but the scaler's internal state becomes inconsistent.

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Improper scaler cycle handling**: When NaN gradients were detected, the code was zeroing gradients and then trying to call `scaler.step()` without ensuring the scaler state was consistent.

2. **Device compatibility**: AMP was enabled even on non-CUDA devices (like MPS), where it's not supported.

3. **Missing error handling**: No fallback mechanism when the scaler encountered internal state errors.

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. **Config Updates** (`config.py`)
```python
# Before
USE_AMP = True  # Always enabled

# After  
USE_AMP = torch.cuda.is_available()  # Only enable on CUDA devices
```

#### 2. **Improved NaN Gradient Handling** (`methods/trainer.py`)
```python
# Before - Problematic approach
if torch.isnan(grad_norm) or torch.isinf(grad_norm):
    self.optimizer.zero_grad()  # This breaks scaler state
    self.scaler.step(self.optimizer)  # Error here!
    self.scaler.update()

# After - Proper scaler state management  
if torch.isnan(grad_norm) or torch.isinf(grad_norm):
    print(f"NaN/Inf gradient norm detected, skipping step")
    self.scaler.update()  # Just update scaler, skip step
    continue
```

#### 3. **Added Robust Error Handling**
```python
try:
    self.scaler.step(self.optimizer)
    self.scaler.update()
except RuntimeError as e:
    if "No inf checks were recorded" in str(e):
        print("Scaler state error, reinitializing...")
        self.scaler = GradScaler('cuda') if torch.cuda.is_available() else None
        if self.scaler is None:
            self.use_amp = False
        continue
    else:
        raise e
```

#### 4. **Enhanced AMP Detection and Logging**
- Better device-specific AMP initialization
- Clear logging of AMP status (enabled/disabled and why)
- Proper autocast device specification with `device_type='cuda'`

#### 5. **Autocast Updates**
```python
# Before
with autocast('cuda'):

# After
with autocast(device_type='cuda', dtype=self.amp_dtype):
```

### Expected Results
1. **No more scaler errors**: Training should proceed without "No inf checks were recorded" errors
2. **Device compatibility**: AMP only enabled on CUDA devices, disabled on MPS/CPU
3. **Graceful degradation**: If AMP fails, training continues without AMP
4. **Better error messages**: Clear logging of what's happening with AMP

### Testing
Created `test_training_fix.py` to verify:
- Trainer initialization works
- Single training step completes successfully  
- AMP is properly enabled/disabled based on device
- No scaler state errors occur

### Notes
- AMP is automatically disabled on MPS (Apple Silicon) and CPU devices
- Training will work with or without AMP enabled
- The scaler state is now properly maintained throughout training
- NaN detection still works but doesn't break the scaler
